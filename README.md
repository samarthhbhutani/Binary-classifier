# Binary-classifier

#Created a binary classifier on Google Colab

#Divided training dataset initially into two classes-Class1, Class2(As it was stored in 2 diff folders) and then created a combined dataset which was #then split into training and validation with 80-20 ratio
#The CNN model was defined using sequential API from tensorflow
#Adam optimizer was used
#The data is then trained batch-wise with a batch size of 32 and 10 epochs
